Bill-Gates

> I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.
> 
> All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing – not because we didn’t care, but because we didn’t know what to do. If we had known how to help, we would have acted.
> 
> The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much complexity.
> 
> To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.
